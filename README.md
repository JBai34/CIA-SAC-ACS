Forked from the open-sourced [Advanced Combat System V2 R15](https://www.roblox.com/library/7118097999/ACS-2-0-0-Official-Release-R15) from ROBLOX, this is originally a private project dedicated to a private MILSIM group existing on the platform though now open-sourced as it is meant to address a lot of the underlying problems with the system's design.

At the time of writing (05/21/2023), this is still an ongoing project with efforts largely focused on class-level refactoring.  Though some parts of this system are working, it is yet to be ready for production release.
